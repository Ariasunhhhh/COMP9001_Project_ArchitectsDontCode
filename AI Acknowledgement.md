## ðŸ¤– AI Acknowledgement

During the development of this project, I used AI-based tools (such as ChatGPT) as learning aids to better understand how to use the following packages:

- `json`  
- `streamlit`  
- `openai`  
- `python-dotenv`

The AI was used to:

- Clarify documentation and usage patterns  
- Provide explanations and examples for concepts I was unfamiliar with  
- Help troubleshoot configuration or environment-related issues

However, **no AI-generated code files were directly copied into this project**.  
All implementation decisions and source code were written and structured manually by me, based on the understanding I developed through research and experimentation.

This project reflects my own learning and understanding â€” with a little AI-powered guidance along the way.
